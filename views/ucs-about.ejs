Hence, better solutions are VERY much desired and needed now.</p>"

Each had prior preferences for future work, but conservatively chose to work together first on fundamental analysis which would properly prioritize choices systematically.  That was, and is, Urban Cruise Ship.</p>"

However, systematic analysis revealed an even wider array of needs and solution "best deals."</p><br><p>Our standards section shows what our attitude has been toward analyzing our options.&nbsp;  Rigorously applying these standards, we reasoned, should result in the best set of priorities. </p><br><p>One type of priority emerged frequently: removal of special-interest subsidies, and getting taxation and regulation right, solve problems in many areas efficiently, as they then allow markets to drive the right choices thereafter.</p>'
