        John van der Harst manages research aims, graphic and language standards,
        human resources, and development for Urban Cruise Ship.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Since 1975, John has been a designer, draftsman and illustrator in the
        fields of architecture, landscape architecture, civil engineering and
        planning, which have included some interior and graphic design, and
        structural, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical drawings. Previously,
        a variety of health-threatening factory work and odd jobs brought
        gratefulness for often-scarce design work opportunities and sensitivity
        toward work opportunity and environmental safety.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Since 1992, John has been president of Recycling Advocates of Middle
        Tennessee, with accomplishments that include the world’s only voluntary
        closure of a large, financially-viable waste-to-energy plant with
        up-to-date air pollution control equipment, banning treated WTE ash as a
        loose construction fill material in many U.S. states, and establishing
        the first statewide “soil-based” compost quality standards as an
        incentive class.&nbsp; Doing so involved economic comparative analysis,
        risk assessment, conducting four pilot wet/dry source separation/processing
        systems, and touring over 200 facilities across the U.S. and Ontario.&nbsp;
        John has described how to achieve true zero-waste across entire municipal
        waste streams, including economic structures which enable this.&nbsp;
        Those include calculating and internalizing presently externalized
        disposal costs.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        John’s advocacy has included leadership on issues ranging from health
        care, peace, third party and bioregional politics, mass transit, scenery
        preservation and billboards, economic disparity, and human and animal
        rights.&nbsp; Since 2002, John’s methods, successes, and personal lifestyle
        led to various published profiles, in two newspapers, two magazines, a
        2004 documentary
