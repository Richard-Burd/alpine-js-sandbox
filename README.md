# alpine-js-sandbox
A place for me to screw around with and learn how to use Alpine.js

### Requirements:

Node.js, NVM, and NPM are required

### Installation instructions (Ubuntu):

1. run: `npm install` to install the alpine.js and express.js node modules
2. run: `npm start` to boot up the application

You should then be able to see the index.html file that looks like this:
