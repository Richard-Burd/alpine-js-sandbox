5. The info.html page has a link to the index.html page
6. The app can display images embedded in an app directory
7. The app can display images from a remote location like imgur.com
8. The info.html page can iterate on a JSON file and display data
9. The .html files can read a .css file and interpret it
10. An .html file can read a .js file and execute it properly
11. The .css file detects a user's media and gracefully degredates text
12. The .css file detects a user's media and gracefully degredates an image
