# alpine-js-sandbox
A place for me to screw around with and learn how to use Alpine.js

### Requirements:

Node.js, NVM, and NPM are required

### Installation instructions (Ubuntu):

1. run: `npm install` to install the alpinejs node module
2. run: `npm start` to boot up the local server at 127.0.0.1; NOTE: this may be different on a Mac, if so go into the ***app.js*** file in the main directory to insert a different address

You should then be able to see the index.html file that looks like this:

### This Node.js application should be able to do the following:

- [x] A Node.js server can read and display an index.html file
- [x] The index.html file contains working Alpine.js components
- [x] A GitHub repo is established for the application
4. The index.html has a link to an info.html page
5. The info.html page has a link to the index.html page
6. The app can display images embedded in an app directory
7. The app can display images from a remote location like imgur.com
8. The info.html page can iterate on a JSON file and display data
9. The .html files can read a .css file and interpret it
10. An .html file can read a .js file and execute it properly
11. The .css file detects a user's media and gracefully degredates text
12. The .css file detects a user's media and gracefully degredates an image
13. A navbar component appears on all html pages in the app
14. The navbar has three .html files listed and properly navigates to them
